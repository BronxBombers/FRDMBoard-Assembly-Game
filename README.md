## NXP FRDM Dev Board Game
A game I created for my final project for a computer engineering course, Assembly Language Programming.
# Basic Summary
The game utilized drivers that I created throughout the course for interrupt based UART I/o, Periodic Interrupt Timer, and LED control.
The board has a green and a red LED, and the game consisted of randomly turning on one, either, or neither, and scoring the player based on
how long it took for them to input what color was currently on.
